## Requirements

python3, nothing else.

## Usage

Download the `testIce.py` and type the following into terminal:

`python3 testIce.py`

or 

`python3 testIce.py -a` for alternating signs on the right boundary (note: by default, the first row arrow points inward. )

You will be prompted to enter the GT pattern. Separate entries by a whitespace. Hit `enter` when finished.

## Limitations

* When a vertex can be filled in multiple ways, arrow directions are assigned in the order up-down-left-right (may need to test all possible cases/branches?)
